# 🎯 Discord Bible Trivia Bot - 24/7 Deployment Guide

## Current Status: ✅ WORKING!
Your Discord bot is **fully functional** and ready for 24/7 deployment.

## 🚨 Option 4: Windows Home Server (⚠️ NOT RECOMMENDED!)

Due to your request, here's the technical setup for using your Windows computer as a 24/7 server:

### ⚠️ **HUGE WARNINGS:**
- **Electricity Cost**: **$200-300/year** of electricity (computer + monitor on 24/7)
- **Power Outages**: Bot goes down when electricity fails
- **Internet Issues**: ISP problems disconnect the bot
- **Performance Hit**: Your computer runs slower for gaming/personal use
- **Security Risk**: Running public-facing service on home network
- **Maintenance**: Windows updates can break the bot
- **Port Forwarding**: Must open ports on home router

### 📋 **Windows Home Server Setup Steps:**

**Step 1: Run Setup Script (As Administrator):**
```cmd
# Double-click setup-windows-startup.bat OR run in command prompt as admin:
setup-windows-startup.bat
```

**Step 2: Create Desktop Shortcuts:**
```cmd
create-desktop-shortcuts.bat
```

**Step 3: Verify Everything Works:**
```cmd
# Monitor your bot status anytime:
monitor-bot.bat
# OR use the desktop shortcut created
```

**Step 4: Configure Windows Startup:**
```cmd
# PM2 should automatically start on boot
# But test by restarting your computer
```

### 💸 **Cost Breakdown (Annual):**
- Electricity (200W computer × 8760 hours): **$350/year**
- ISP overage fees: **$50-100/year** (if not unlimited)
- Additional hardware wear: **$50-100/year**
- **Total Annual Cost: $450-550** ❌

### ❓ **"Why Is This So Expensive?"**
A computer uses electricity even when "idle" - PM2 keeps your computer running processes even when you're not using it!

## 💰 Hosting Options (Best to Worst)

### 🥇 **Option 1: Railway (Most Professional - $5/month)**
```bash
# Railway account at railway.app
# Connect GitHub repo automatically
# One-click deploy with PM2
```

**Pros:**
- Automatic deployments from Git
- Built-in PM2 equivalent
- CPU/memory monitoring
- SSL certificates included
- Environment variable management
- **99.9% uptime guaranteed**

### 🥈 **Option 2: DigitalOcean Droplet ($6/month)**
```bash
# Create Ubuntu 22.04 droplet
ssh root@your-server-ip

# Install Node.js and PM2
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs git

# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gospelways.git
cd gospelways/discord-bot
npm install

# Setup PM2 startup
npm install -g pm2
pm2 startup
pm2 save
```

### 🥉 **Option 3: Dedicated Home Server (One-time $200-400)**
- Buy mini-PC with Ubuntu Server pre-installed
- Install in wiring closet, never turn off
- Much better than Windows computer method
- Independent power supply recommended

## 🚀 Quick Deploy to Railway (Recommended)

2. **Connect GitHub**: Authorize, select your repo
3. **Auto-deploy**: Railway detects package.json and runs PM2
